# telosbrowser

A search browser that allows us to view html data stored in the telos blockchain.

It provides redunancy across 32 nodes and notifies the user if less than 3 confirmations are met.


## Getting Started

If you have a telos account, please create a table with the same name as the account name and assign html data to "domainvalue" in the first row of the table.

We can search by the account name which will return this html data.

eg. as a sample, account name akatsukitsui is searchable via telosbrowser.

Thankyou for reading.
